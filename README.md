# Auto-encoder-of-the-quark-gluon-events

To accomplish this task, will use PyTorch to implement a variational autoencoder (VAE) for learning the representation of quark/gluon jet events based on three image channels: ECAL, HCAL, and Tracks. ill train the VAE on the provided dataset and then visualize a side-by-side comparison of original and reconstructed events.

Implementation steps:

Load and preprocess the dataset.
Define the VAE architecture.
Define the loss function.
Train the VAE.
Visualize the original and reconstructed events.
